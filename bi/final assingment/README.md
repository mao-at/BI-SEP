# Final-Assignment
This project is designed to simulate a full workflow of a Data Analyst from getting data off the Database to manipulate it with the use of Python and Pandas module to present it through both matplotlib module and PBI/Tableau.

The concept is that we are given a dataset that contains Liquor Sales in the state of Iowa in USA between 2012-2020 and we are asked to find the most popular item per zipcode and the percentage of sales per store in the period between 2016-2019.

We are also asked to visualize the Data and present them in both a matplotlib format and in PBI/Tableau.

Every calculation and transformation of Data has to happen through a Python Script. 

## The visualization should look similar to something like this, but you are free to experiment. :
