# Final-Assignment
This project is designed to simulate a full workflow of a Data Analyst from getting data off the Database to manipulate it with the use of Python and Pandas module to present it through matplotlib, PBI, and Tableau.

The concept is that we are given a dataset that contains Liquor Sales in the state of Iowa in USA between 2012-2020 and we are asked to find the most popular item per zipcode and the percentage of sales per store in the period between 2016-2019.

We are also asked to visualize the Data and present them in matplotlib, PBI, and Tableau.

Every calculation and transformation of Data has to happen through a Python Script. 

### The visualization should look similar to something like this, but you are free to experiment. :


### 1.  If you are using Matplotlib
